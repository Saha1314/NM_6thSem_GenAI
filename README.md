# Advanced Diabetes Retinopathy Detection

This repository contains code for a deep learning model aimed at classifying the severity of diabetic retinopathy from retinal images. The model leverages the state-of-the-art EfficientNetB3 architecture and is trained on a dataset comprising retinal images categorized into different classes of diabetic retinopathy severity.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Diabetic Retinopathy Dataset, obtained from [insert dataset source]. The dataset consists of retinal images annotated with labels representing different stages of diabetic retinopathy severity. The classes in the dataset include:

- **Healthy**: Images showing no signs of diabetic retinopathy.
- **Mild Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)**: Images displaying mild signs of diabetic retinopathy.
- **Moderate DR**: Images exhibiting moderate signs of diabetic retinopathy.
- **Proliferate DR**: Images showing proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
- **Severe DR**: Images indicating severe diabetic retinopathy.

The dataset is preprocessed to ensure consistency in image sizes and formats, and it is split into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate model development and evaluation.
