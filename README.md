# Advanced Diabetes Retinopathy Detection

This repository contains code for a deep learning model aimed at classifying the severity of diabetic retinopathy from retinal images. The model leverages the state-of-the-art EfficientNetB3 architecture and is trained on a dataset comprising retinal images categorized into different classes of diabetic retinopathy severity.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of retinal images annotated with labels representing different stages of diabetic retinopathy severity. The classes in the dataset include:

- **Healthy**: Images showing no signs of diabetic retinopathy.
- **Mild Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)**: Images displaying mild signs of diabetic retinopathy.
- **Moderate DR**: Images exhibiting moderate signs of diabetic retinopathy.
- **Proliferate DR**: Images showing proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
- **Severe DR**: Images indicating severe diabetic retinopathy.

The dataset is preprocessed to ensure consistency in image sizes and formats, and it is split into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate model development and evaluation.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to clone this repository. You can install them using the following command: git clone 


## Steps invloved in the implementation of the project

### 1. Data Preparation
- Download the Diabetic Retinopathy Dataset and organize it into separate directories for each class of diabetic retinopathy severity.
- Ensure that the dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets according to the specified ratios.

### 2. Model Training
- Execute the provided Python script to preprocess the data, train the deep learning model, and evaluate its performance.
- The script incorporates advanced techniques such as data augmentation, batch normalization, and dropout regularization to enhance the model's robustness and generalization capabilities.

### 3. Evaluation
- After training, assess the model's performance using various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Visualize the training and validation accuracy and loss curves to gain insights into the model's learning process and convergence behavior.

### 4. Deployment
- Save the trained model to disk for future use or deployment in production environments.
- Ensure compatibility with the target deployment environment by considering factors such as hardware requirements, software dependencies, and integration protocols.

## Results

The trained deep learning model demonstrates promising performance in classifying diabetic retinopathy severity, achieving satisfactory accuracy and loss metrics on both the training and validation datasets. Detailed evaluation results, including confusion matrix and classification report, are provided to facilitate comprehensive analysis.
